TOMAS -- Total-mRNA-Aware Single Cell Analysis
==============================================

**TOMAS** is a Python package for **TO**\tal-**M**\RNA-**A**\ware **S**\ingle-cell RNA-seq data analysis. TOMAS provides a computational control of total mRNA contents in droplet-based single cell RNA-seq data. It empowers accurate scRNA-seq analysis for datasets with large total mRNA content differences between cell types. TOMAS paves the way for future large-scale, low per-cell cost, doublet-rich droplet-based scRNA-seq experiments, which improves the sensitivity and the statistical power in detecing and studying rare cell types.
